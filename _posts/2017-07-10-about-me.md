<h1> Main Purpose </h1>
This is the blog of blueysky27(@blueysky27.github.io). I will basically focus on three topics.

<h2> Comments </h2>
Comments on some hot topics, mostly about China and Peking University. Such things would be written in English because of government surveliance, and no forks are allowed.

<h2> Animes </h2>
I am a great anime fan, and I will sometimes write articles about some great animes I've watched to let more people watch it. In fact, I've already written some in Chinese.

<h2> Codes </h2>
I have been learning computer science for two years now, and I will sometimes share and interpret my codes on Github(like the projects of computational physics last term, which I still haven't posted), or share my wills on some papers about machine learning and deep learning. I am doing researches about computer vision right now, although still new in this area.
